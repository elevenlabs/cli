# ElevenLabs API Keys for E2E Testing
# Get your API keys from: https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys

# ⚠️  CRITICAL: Use DEDICATED EMPTY TEST ACCOUNTS
#
# DO NOT use your production account or any account with deployed agents!
# E2E tests will create, modify, and DELETE agents during testing.
# Any existing agents in the workspace could be PERMANENTLY LOST.
#
# To set up test accounts:
# 1. Create TWO separate new ElevenLabs accounts at https://elevenlabs.io
# 2. Generate an API key for each account
# 3. Add the keys below
# 4. Keep these accounts empty - only for automated testing

# Primary test API key (required for all e2e tests)
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_test_account_api_key_here

# Secondary test API key (optional - only needed for multi-environment e2e tests)
# Multi-environment tests verify the CLI can handle multiple environments (prod, staging, dev, etc.)
# If not provided, multi-environment tests will be skipped
ELEVENLABS_TEST_API_KEY=your_second_test_account_api_key_here

# For local development and testing:
# 1. Copy this file to .env (DO NOT COMMIT .env)
#    cp .env.example .env
# 2. Add your TEST account API keys to .env
# 3. Verify both test accounts are empty
# 4. Run tests: npm run test:e2e

# Note: The .env file is gitignored and will not be committed
